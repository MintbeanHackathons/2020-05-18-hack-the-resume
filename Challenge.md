# Today's Objective: Hack the Resume

## Objective

Today's objective is to create an easily-updatable resume that is automatically generated from a JSON object!

# Why a standardized data format for résumés is important

Having standardized data formats lets people collaborate on building a better ecosystem of tools. Here are a few examples where this has already happened:

1. The `*.mp3` format allows music creators, streaming companies, software companies, open source tools, and listeners focus on making & sharing great music.
1. The `*.csv` format lets all kinds of software systems talk to each other using imports/exports, while letting human beings retain the ability to clean and format large datasets using tools that understand `*.csv` files.
1. Image formats like `*.png`, `*.jpg`, `*.gif` 
1. The `http` protocol

A standardized résumé format, if one arises, enables many cool things:
* Candidates could automatically apply for 1000's of jobs in bulk.
* Candidates could simple "install" pre-made themes on top of their resume data.
* Candidates would experience less bias in the screening process, because résumé design and writing skills become less important for success.
* Candidates would become much more discoverable, because the structured data allows more efficient sorting/filtering
* Data scientists could run deeper analyses of the job market on well-structured data.
* The community could build advanced tools on top of the résumé format that could enable functionality that we haven't yet thought of.

And there are probably many, many more advantages that aren't listed here.

## Requirements

Your goal is to create a resume from a simple JSON object. 

You can use the [JSON Resume Schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) library if you wish, or you can create your own rendering logic.

The most featureful and visually appealing resume stands a chance of winning.

### Suggested Libraries

* [JSON Resume Schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/)

### Bonus points

You get bonus points for any features other than the above that you can successfully demo. 

For example:

* Live preview (where your edits in an input area automatically show up in the preview panel)
* Selectable themes for the resume
* Print to PDF
* Responsive design 

The most interesting, useful, and cool designs will have a chance of winning. So, get creative :-)

## Frameworks:

It is completely possible to build this using vanilla JS or jQuery. You can use React, Vue, Angular if you wish.

## Restrictions

* Your project must use JavaScript.

There are no other restrictions.

## Tips for success:

1. The project is intentionally simple so you can focus on code quality.
1. The requirements are intentionally minimalistic so you can get as creative as you'd like.
1. Making your project look nice will make it more appealing to employers!
